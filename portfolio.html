        <h2>Campaign: The Year of the Burned Sleep</h2>
        In the year 1133 P.T., now infamously known as the Year of the Burned Sleep, a terrifying plague swept across the lands of Khorvaguad. Nightmares have become all too real, with those who dare to sleep awakening no more, their bodies found charred as if consumed by an unseen inferno. Fear of sleep now grips the hearts of many, pushing them to seek out magical wards or potent substances to stave off rest. The Merchants Guild, ever opportunistic, has monopolized safety, offering dream-warded inns at an exorbitant cost, making uninterrupted rest a luxury few can afford. Survivors speak of waking within their dreams, surrounded by demons of flame or monstrous, fire-breathing beasts. In desperation, some turn to the Citari Elves’ Dream Powder—a temporary escape from sleep, though it comes at a cost. As the nightmares worsen, no one knows how long this cursed year will last or how many more lives it will claim.
